Please Look After This Englishman

In March 2011, I travelled coast-to-coast across the USA staying with members of my online social network and using social media to help decide where to go next. 

I'm now experimenting with re-telling the stories from that trip, using github to share the content and the open up the process to collaborators, readers and other content-creators.
