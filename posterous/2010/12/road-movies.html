<p>In the run up to the trip, I'd like to institute a weekly film screening after Tuttle on Fridays to watch some of the best movies about roadtrips (preferably across the USA but maybe other journeys too)</p>
<p>The deal will be that Tuttle will finish at 12 as usual, there'll be a break for people to get lunch if they haven't brought it with them (or popcorn!) and then we'll get started at 1pm.&nbsp; There'll be an opportunity to have a further semi-formal discussion/conversation after the movie for those who wish to.</p>
<p>Buttonhole me please with suggestions for suitable movies - they're even more likely to be shown if you can also provide me with the DVD :)</p></div>
