<p>This was perhaps one of the most physically challenging and dangerous moments of the trip.&nbsp; Yes, climbing down from a train onto a little stool and down to the ground in Alpine, TX.&nbsp; Not exactly xtreme adrenaline junkie stuff, is it?</p>
<p>But when I talk to people about travelling coast-to-coast in this way, many of them look at me in the same way they might if I was telling them I was going to <a href="http://inthebluecorner.posterous.com" target="_blank">climb into a cage and fight someone</a> or bungee jump or go white-water rafting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a kind of adventure for the physically cowardly like me.&nbsp; I was never afraid for my personal physical safety on the first trip - well, momentarily and needlessly when I had my <a href="http://tuttle2texas.posterous.com/daily-story-digest-3" target="_blank">first experience of NYC</a> I suppose but not for very long.</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">My senses already heightened by men wearing two overcoats tied up with string, I emerged onto 7th Avenue ready to see what the isle of Manhattan had to offer.  Well the first thing was a couple arguing - not the sort of low-level passive aggressive bickering you see from couples in IKEA - no, full on, sassy. "you ain't nevah gonna see yo' children agin mofo" screaming match - just marching straight through the tourists.  Tired, jetlagged, uptight and suffering from an imagination overfed with way too many nights under the blankets reading Amazing Spiderman as a youngster, I really didn't know whether to laugh out loud or hit the deck because the shooting was going to start.  So I looked to Dana.  Who was laughing.  Not at the couple but at me, for being such an out-of-towner.</blockquote>
<p>And I would never even go snowboarding, let alone jump off something tied to a piece of elastic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But *this* kind of adventure appeals to me, the challenge of just making progress towards some goal every day and being as present and authentic as possible.&nbsp; I'm not just living this when I go away, it's become a way of life, where there isn't a plan, a job, a safety net, but as long as I keep moving, talking about it, asking for help, that help and the resources I need happen to appear just at the right time.</p>
<p>Looking back on the first trip, it all seems incredibly safe.&nbsp; What was I worried about? The people around me at the time didn't know.&nbsp; I try to remember this now that I'm stretching the concept a bit further and then start feeling scared about it.&nbsp; Being a bit scared is what it's all about, It's all part of the adventure.</p></div>
