<p><strong>For the 2010 trip</strong></p>
<p>In my one-man social media empire bag this year I had:</p>
<p>My trusty, but aging, Nokia N95 and Asus eeepc 1000H</p>
<p>Loaned Canon 500D, Nokia N900, Nokia 3G Booklet</p>
<p>While away, I bought a US sim card with "unlimited" data from T-mobile for one month.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.techsuperpowers.com">Mike Oh</a> in Boston loaned me a lens for the Canon because it hadn't come with one (!) and an SD card</p>
<p>I took about 1000 pictures over the three weeks.&nbsp; Most of them with the Canon but did get some with the N900 although picture quality wasn't as good as on the N95.&nbsp; I didn't have my N95 charged and ready to go all the time, because it wouldn't play as nicely with the US sim card as the N900.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I didn't find much use for the 3G booklet - it was lighter than my Asus but the 3G would only have been useful on the move and there was very poor signal on all of the trains we used.&nbsp; In any case, I prefer to write when I'm sitting still and take in what's going on when I'm moving.</p>
<p>I would have made better use of the N900 if I had had an intro to it before I left.&nbsp; It wasn't until New York that I found out how to zoom in and out on the screen :)</p>
<p>Likewise I would have shot much more video if I'd been more familiar with the Canon before leaving.&nbsp; I didn't get the hang of it until I was in Austin... I simply didn't have time to read the manual on the road.</p>
<p>With hindsight, I think I should have made a case to get Canon and Nokia to let me have those devices for the year of my residency at C4CC rather than just for the three weeks of the trip.&nbsp; If I have another residency this year I'll give it a go - there's so much more value I can bring with kit that I know well and can rely on having for a while.&nbsp; The other issue raised by having a short-term loan was that I worried more (perhaps irrationally) about damage or loss.</p>
<p>The thing I really felt the lack of was a computer that could handle the HD video that the Canon pumps out - both in terms of working on stuff while away, but also editing things together afterwards. I also worried a lot about only having one copy of pics and vids that I'd shot.</p>
<p>When looking to cost this, the kit I was loaned retails today at:</p>
<p>Canon 500D &pound;515</p>
<p>Nokia N900 &pound;350</p>
<p>T-mobile sim $50 = &pound;33</p>
<p>3G Booklet &pound;520</p>
<p>4GB SD Card - &pound;5</p>
<p>Total I would have had to lay out on kit: <strong>&pound;1423</strong></p>
<p><strong>For the next trip</strong></p>
<p>Now the things I don't have for this year's trip yet are:</p>
<p>A DSLR &amp; decent lens that shoots HD &amp; some large data storage cards</p>
<p>Some large USB sticks for data backup.</p>
<p>A light-ish laptop that can comfortably handle HD video</p>
<p>A smartphone with US sim and a friendly data plan</p>
<p>Open to suggestions on how to acquire the above.&nbsp; A longer term deal that might include support for my continuing Social Art would be preferable to me and doubtless of more value to the sponsor than a loan just for the duration of the trip.</p></div>
