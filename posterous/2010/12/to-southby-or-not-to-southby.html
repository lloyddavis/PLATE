<p>Well it didn't come as a great surprise but I got confirmation yesterday that my panel about <a href="http://tuttle2texas.posterous.com/">Tuttle2Texas</a> (last year's trip) has not been accepted in the (pretty much) final round of selection for the South By South West Interactive Festival.</p>
<p>I don't know the reason it wasn't selected.&nbsp; Obviously with the large numbers of entries, there isn't any specific feedback.&nbsp; I can only assume that "they" don't get "it" - I've not gone through the accepted panels and done any rigorous analysis on which British panels were chosen and anything I say looks like sour grapes anyway.</p>
<p>So it raises a question or two:&nbsp; Why do I still have Austin as a stopping place in the middle of the plan.&nbsp; Do I need to go to Austin? Was I only going to speak?&nbsp; Is it too much of a constraint?&nbsp; What could I do that was interesting in Austin without going to SXSWi?&nbsp; What could I do elsewhere in the states at the same time as SXSWi that would still be connected but not actually being there?&nbsp; Why am I going in March if it's not tied in with being in Austin for March 11th to 15th?&nbsp; What is the trip called if I don't go to Texas?</p>
<p>Hmmm....</p></div>
