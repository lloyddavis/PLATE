<p>So now that I've stripped this trip right down, I'm starting to bring in a bit more complexity. And this morning I was thinking introducing the idea of racing someone.&nbsp; Or more than one.&nbsp; How about it?</p>
<p>How about we choose a mutual starting point on the West Coast and pledge to attempt to meet up in Austin and then again at some finishing spot on the East Coast.&nbsp; But what happens in between is up to us and our networks.</p>
<p>What might happen?&nbsp; Who would you like to see "race" against me? Would I care if I "lost"?&nbsp; What would "losing" or "winning" look like?&nbsp; We could turn that into an event perhaps - a closing thing (in NYC or back home in London?) where we all got together and swapped stories in front of an audience...</p>

<div class='response_body'>@podchef - don't you worry, you're on the list!<p>@patrickhadfield - I thought of the first one, yes, now wondering who might be up for taking part.  The second, somehow, had not occurred to me.   Though it also reminds me that I was talking to @jackcabnory about using London Cabs at one point...</p></div>
