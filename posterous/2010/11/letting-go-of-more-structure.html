<h3>Letting go of more structure</h3>

<div class='post_body'>I&#39;ve had some conversations in the last few days that have encouraged me to think more about minimising structure.  <p />This is a recurring theme in my work.  With #tuttle we ended up with it&#39;s Friday at 10am at the same place each week and I will show up so that there&#39;s at least one person for someone to talk to.  And it worked - it seemed like far too flimsy a proposition, but it gave the space for amazing things to happen.  So the question is always &quot;How little stucture do you need for something interesting or useful to happen? Is there anything you can take away without the whole thing collapsing?&quot;<p /> I come back to thinking about this adventure as a minimal story, with a beginning, middle and an end.  The beginning is that I fly from London to somewhere on the West Coast.  The middle is that I travel across the USA somehow, including spending some time at SXSWi and meeting up with at least some of the people I met last year.  The end is that I fly home from the East Coast.<p /> What that does is to open up all sorts of possibilities for the middle, including involving people in decisions more, allowing myself to be taken places I wouldn&#39;t ordinarily go and do things I wouldn&#39;t ordinarily do.  The big difference is that I&#39;m letting go of the train as the primary means of transport.  I like using public transport and it was good to see that it was doable via Amtrak last year, *and* I still want to do some of the journey that way, but I think there&#39;s also much to be said for me doing part of the journey by tweeting &quot;I&#39;m in Vegas, anyone heading in an easterly direction tomorrow and want a travel buddy?&quot;  It also means I can take more of a zig-zag route and not exclude big bits of the country just because they&#39;re not served by Amtrak.<p /> Or something.</div>
