<p>I want to use this trip to explore issues around the value of social capital.</p>
<p>Whenever I've had a conversation about the usefulness of social media and online social networking with representatives of a brand or organisation, we often end up talking about return on investment and how to measure it.</p>
<p>I'm fond of glibly saying that the return on investment in using social tools is social capital, it's not that there is no return it's just that it's difficult to measure and it requires some other process in order to turn it into capital that we're more used to using intransactions.&nbsp; I believe this, because I live this - my income is largely dependent on the investment I've made in my social networks and online presence in the last few years.</p>
<p>So you could say that everything I do, including these trips, is paid for, or at least subsidised, by the value generated by all those blog posts, video blogs, podcasts, personal appearances, tuttle club meetings, chats over coffee, smiles and waves across a conference hall, inane but sometimes serendipitously useful tweeting that I've been doing.&nbsp; That every one of those actions was a deposit in my social capital bank.&nbsp; And that when it came for me to say "OK, I'm going to go across the US with very little money" I was calling on those reserves, I was asking you to convert the social capital you hold in my name into cash and paypal it to me to help me get to the next town.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, last year, we also asked for, and received, help in kind that was also a conversion of our social capital.&nbsp; For example, finding somewhere to stay in New Orleans was significantly easier because I had invested in my relationship with <a href="http://www.taylordavidson.com" target="_blank">Taylor Davidson</a>, himself a very smart cookie in the social capital markets.</p>
<p>This leads me to a thought experiment that might form the basis of this year's trip.&nbsp; Suppose that I made an estimate of the cost of doing all the things I end up doing on the trip - I mean what if I had to pay for everything?&nbsp; That might tell me just how much I would have required if my social capital had been close to zero.&nbsp; If I then take away the amount of cash I actually expend over the period, what does that tell us?&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems to me that it's a rough estimate of the amount of social capital I am able to convert into cash and goods in that context over a month.&nbsp; Of course there are no benchmarks to measure this against and doubtless there'd have to be a list of assumptions and caveats as long as your arm, but wouldn't that be an interesting thing to try to calculate? Even if all it told you was that it was about &pound;10 or &pound;100 or &pound;1,000?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would you like to know?&nbsp; Would someone you know pay for research like that?</p></div>

<div class='response_body'>Whenever I get asked the same question about what's the value of Social Media Engagement I always tell people to go back to marketing basics. Go back to how we can measure brand - again another difficult thing to put a number against but the same rules apply.<p>The more familiar you are with something, particularly if thats in a positive way, the more likely you are to get a 'conversion'. It doesn't matter if that conversion is a purchase or the offer of a free room for the night.</p><p>Old brand building was all about lots of shouting through TV, now it's more about whispering directly into someones ear through social media - more direct, not as loud, but it can be just as effective (if not more so) in the long term.</p></div>
