<h3>So Tired</h3>

<div class='post_body'><p>Reaching the end, I'm realising how tired I am. &nbsp;In comes in a few forms:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Ineffective sleep. &nbsp;Last year I thought it was bad with a 14-hour overnight from DC to Atlanta and the 32-hour marathon from Austin to LA. &nbsp;So of course I've pushed it even further this time. &nbsp;I've spent 7 of the past 25 nights sleeping in a coach seat (I think... my counting abilities may be suffering) - yeah, none of the journeys I've done have come without an overnight. &nbsp;That's after an 11-hour flight during which I only got an hour or two. &nbsp;The rest of the time I've had lovely comfy beds to sleep in, but sleeping sitting up or even lying down across two seats almost 1 night in 3 is taking it's toll.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Doing too much. &nbsp;I've found find it really hard to say no to stuff. &nbsp;That's because I'm giving up control and asking for help, right? Well yes giving up control, but I realise that I have to ask for help around getting proper rest. &nbsp;That might mean having to say no to more stuff in the interests of self-care. On the other hand, I can't imagine anything that I've said yes to that I'd rather have had a couple of hours napping over. &nbsp;And it's not just other people asking me. &nbsp;I spent way too much time walking around Chicago the other day, completely of my own accord. &nbsp;I was just so wrapped up in being somewhere new and not having anyone around that I ended up walking quite a few miles. &nbsp;My legs ache. &nbsp;It's good to have the exercise when the rest of the time I'm sitting down, but it didn't do much for my energy levels.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Food. &nbsp;I've had fantastic, delicious and nutritious meals courtesy of my hosts and friends along the way. &nbsp;But I don't normally eat in restaurants this often and I'm normally quite strict about what I eat and when. &nbsp;And although I've been careful, I have eaten much more bread, cheese and eggs than I would do normally, it's difficult to get enough vegetables or salad except when I've stocked up at supermarkets and sneaky bits of sugar have a way of creeping into everything. &nbsp;I could have done more to make sure I had what I needed for breakfast every day - I always make it a priority at home, but I find it hard to insist on what I need when people are already being so kind.</p>
<p>4. Time Changes. &nbsp;I'm not sure about this one, but I think it adds to my tiredness that my body is a little confused about what time it is. &nbsp;I do always have half an eye on what time it is in the UK. &nbsp;I've also been through all the time zones here in the last three weeks as well as the Daylight Savings Change a couple of weeks ago. &nbsp;I'm glad that I'll only have a 5 hour difference to deal with when I get back rather than the PDT/BST that I faced last year.</p>
<p>5. Just Travelling. &nbsp;It's tiring in itself isn't it? &nbsp;I always forget this. &nbsp;Just the massive stimulation of going somewhere new ever day. &nbsp;Meeting new people or seeing old friends that I haven't talked to before. &nbsp;Not really knowing where you're sleeping tonight or what you'll be doing tomorrow. &nbsp;Stimulating, exciting, unmissable and exhausting.</p></div>
