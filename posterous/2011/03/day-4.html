<div class='post_body'> 	 	 	 <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Friday was my last day in the Bay Area. Briefly after breakfast, I managed to IM with my daughter (who was just about to have her tea) – that felt good, to be able to just chat for a bit, hear what&#39;s going on for her, let her know that I&#39;m OK and having a good time.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Robert then gave me a great last day. I said goodbye to Maryam and the boys and we headed to do an interview with a software company – Robert&#39;s stock-in-trade. Driving along, I saw the sign for parc “umm... that&#39;s parc parc?” “yeah” it was weird that even after being in the area for 3 days it took for me to see that building, just another office building of course, but y&#39;know... parc, for me to really understand that I was actually in Silicon Valley</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Robert drove in and around the building for me “yeah over there&#39;s the room where they invented the mouse, there&#39;s a bit of original PC ethernet on the wall down there”</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The place we were actually visiting had no parking spaces “that&#39;s how you can tell someone&#39;s doing well – no space in the parking lot at 10.30am”</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">After watching Robert do his stuff, we headed back to USVP for the last few TED Talks including Roger Ebert&#39;s brave piece about losing large parts of his face and therefore his voice. And the one about the schoolteacher and the World Peace Game.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Robert then had to take part in the Gillmor Gang which was an hour or so that I could sit quietly do some thinking, catch up with people online and record a couple of video pieces – including one of reassurance to my dear mama.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/RBuV3vDlBLI?wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen frameborder="0" height="417" width="500"></iframe></p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">We had the rest of the afternoon to explore. I got the guided tour of Stanford, a sneaky peak of the self-driving cars, stopped off and saw the Golden Spike and the Rodin garden, - I needed some groceries for my meals on the train up to Seattle and I also needed to get a tripod attachment to hold my N8. Robert took me to a camera store. I spent $14.15 on my phone holder. He spent a little bit more than I did and got some bits of kit that I&#39;m sure plenty of fanboys will be asking him about it at SXSW. So then we finished off with a lightning tour of Mountain View “there&#39;s Google” the Computer History Museum “there&#39;s a big chunk of ENIAC, there&#39;s the original server rack from Google”</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">And then suddenly we were back at Palo Alto Caltrain station and shaking hands and saying goodbye till next weekend and I was on my own again.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">It&#39;s only a short hop down to San Jose. And that&#39;s where I stayed for the next 5 hours because the train up to Seattle was delayed by nearly 2 hours. I got my rail pass, my ticket to Seattle and the next one too to Milwaukee. And I sat and watched the world go by. I was just nodding off when the call came and we were shepherded onto the train. I sat down, took out my contacts and slept.</p></div>
