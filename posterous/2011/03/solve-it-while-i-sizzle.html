<div class='post_body'><div>So I need to get from Lafayette to New Orleans tomorrow (Sunday).  I thought I had a ride, but it looks like it&#39;s fallen through. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a bus but it looks like it takes forever.</div> <p /><div>This trip&#39;s a great exercise in expecting the unexpected and accepting whatever comes along.  That means not labelling things as &quot;wrong&quot; just because they don&#39;t fit with what i was expecting or what I think would be most comfortable for me.</div> <p /><div>I can get Amtrak, I believe (and as it&#39;s only $21 so I may pay cash rather than using up one of the segments on my pass) but I also don&#39;t want to rush into making a decision if there are other options out there - trying to keep an open mind, as ever, and not just pressing on regardless.</div> <p /><div>So I guess the question is, are you or someone you know, by chance travelling from Lafayette to New Orleans and have space for a friendly, house-trained brit with a stack of stories to tell from his adventures?  To be on the safe side I&#39;m going to make a reservation on Amtrak if no other offers show up by about 6pm Central Time today (11pm GMT)</div> <p /><div>Oh... the &quot;sizzle&quot;? it&#39;s 80F and sunny here, folks.  As a fully paid-up Mad Dog/Englishman i just went for a walk in the midday sun... :)</div></div>
