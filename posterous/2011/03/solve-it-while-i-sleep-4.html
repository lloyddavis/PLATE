<div class='post_body'>Getting to Lafayette <p /><div>I&#39;ve planned a few days rest near Lafayette LA before moving onto New Orleans - it&#39;s a kind of mid-point decompression after SXSW.  I&#39;d really like to be there as long as I can - Thursday thru Sunday.  I misread the Amtrak timetable and thought I could leave Austin on Wednesday night and get to Lafayette on Thursday.  I can&#39;t.  The next train there leaves on Thursday gets in Friday morning.  My lovely hostess in Austin, <a href="http://twitter.com/orchid8">Sarah Vela</a>, can&#39;t have me beyond Wednesday.</div> <p /><div>So do I:</div><p /><div>Stick with the train (i have a rail pass so the cost is covered) and find a way to stay in Austin until Thursday night and put up with the fact that I&#39;ll only be in Lafayette for 3 days instead of 4?</div> <p /><div>or</div><p /><div>Find someone who is driving to, say, New Orleans leaving Wednesday who might be able to take me and drop me off in Lafayette? Do you know anyone doing <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/aWpg">Austin to Louisiana</a> who might like an Englishman riding shotgun?</div> <p /><div>or something else... that gets me there on Thursday morning (or Wednesday night perhaps) with minimal cost and hassle and maximum interestingness.</div></div>
