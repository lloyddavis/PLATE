<div class='post_body'><p>Not quite sizzling yet. &nbsp;I haven't been out so I'm air-conditioned, but my computer tells me it's only 72F just before 10am :)</p>
<p>So, weather chit-chat aside, where next?</p>
<p>Strike that! *Who* next - this is a journey across a network of people and while the places I've been have all been hugely interesting in themselves, it's really been the people that have made it. That said, I do need to engage with the Amtrak network to get to these people... so I'm not totally unconstrained.</p>
<p>OK. &nbsp;Well I have just over a week left. &nbsp;I'm going to stay here in NOLA tonight and travel tomorrow. &nbsp;I have to be in NYC next Thursday evening to catch a flight from JFK. &nbsp;But all else is up for grabs. &nbsp;How long I take to get to New York and how much time I spend there is yet to be decided, although it's such a highly-populated area I'd like to arrive there next Wednesday at the latest so that I have at least one night in the city. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As usual i'll lay out the facts and see what comes back.</p>
<p>Who do I know on the Eastern side of the country and where are they? &nbsp;Well I have quite a few (I need to clarify that, some I've spoken to already but I can always find more) in the NYC area. &nbsp;I had an invitation to visit Huntingdon PA from Jagir Patel when we met in Austin. &nbsp;And I would very much like to get up into Maine to visit one of my oldest internet buddies that I've never met f2f, Neal Foley (@podchef)</p>
<p>I have six segments left on my rail pass - a segment is on one line so if I went to say Cincinnati via Chicago that would count as two segments.</p>
<p>Here's some information about trains:</p>
<p>There are two trains that go North and East from NO. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Crescent is the one we took last year down from DC via Atlanta - it actually goes all the way to New York with a stop in Philadelphia too. (leaves NO at 7am!)</p>
<p>The City of New Orleans goes up to Chicago via Memphis. &nbsp;(leaves NO at 1.45pm)</p>
<p>I think it's important to focus on the next right step rather than trying to map out the whole thing. I think I could go either way but need some input to help think things through, keep me on track, drag me back to principles. &nbsp;So I think the simple questions are "Crescent or City of NO?" and "Where do I get off and who can I stay with?"</p>
<p>I'm going to need to make a decision this evening (I'm on CDT still - GMT -5 so before UK people go to bed works!) &nbsp;Let me know what you think or if you need more information to make suggestions.</p></div>
