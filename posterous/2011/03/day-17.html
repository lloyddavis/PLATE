<p>Here's me, frowning into the sun at Austin Amtrak station. &nbsp;I wasn't really that frowny, just had the sun in my eyes. &nbsp;I wasn't as euphoric as I had been exactly 1 year earlier though either. &nbsp;Then I was humming "Homeward Bound" to myself. &nbsp;This time I knew I was only just half way through and I had as much of a challenge ahead of me as I'd had getting this far.</p>
<p>St Patrick's Day for me started with breakfast of scrambled eggs and sausage with the Higginbottoms and then my first bus ride (still $1 even that far out) into Austin. &nbsp;It was interesting to see everything getting "weirder" as we got downtown. &nbsp;Also had my first little ride through the UT end of town.</p>
<p>I spent the morning sitting in the Chevy Lounge at the conventiion centre. Recharging my device and personal batteries and getting a little writing and tweeting done. &nbsp;I got talking to @hiphopchronicles (who lives in Ealing, of course) when we were approached by a booth babe for a backpack manufacturer called Slappa. &nbsp;I had to ask her twice to be sure that's what she was saying. &nbsp;We explained that that word had some connotations for English ears. &nbsp;She was a little surprised, but didn't seem worried.</p>

<p>It became clear to me sitting in that corner, watching music artists being interviewed that there's a real opportunity for some consulting at the crossover between the festivals. &nbsp;The music people are crying out for help with understanding how to use these tools to support their work. &nbsp;Some more of those social media "experts" should stick around and pick up some big-haired or well-blinged clients instead of hopping on a plane straight back to whichever coast they came from. &nbsp;Hmmm....</p>
<p>I managed to find Nat and Julia for a goodbye thankyou and hug before I walked through the crowds of green-clad music fans and got a health power-up by eating &nbsp;at Whole Foods and stocking up for the journey ahead. &nbsp;Then it was over to the railway station to sit and wait for the hopefully not too late train.</p>
<p>Which is how I came to be frowning into the sun.</p>
<p>We rolled out of Austin only half an hour later than scheduled. &nbsp;However, I'd somehow gotten onto the kiddy car. &nbsp;I shared my 3 hours or so down to San Antonio with little Luciano and his sister and their grown-ups. &nbsp;They were all excited &nbsp;but only the kids were screaming in the high-pitched way that goes right through you.</p>
<p>Off at San Antonio to wait for the Sunset Limited coming through from Los Angeles. &nbsp;It was on time. &nbsp;If anything it was early. &nbsp;It didn't stay that way.</p></div>
