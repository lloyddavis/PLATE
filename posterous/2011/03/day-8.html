<div class='post_body'>I had a better night on the train, well kinda.  I worked out a couple of comfortable positions to lie in (for some value of comfortable) and I alternated between them.  At one point I thought &quot;There&#39;s a blog post in here: &#39;The 10 most comfortable ways to sleep in a coach seat on Amtrak&#39;&quot; but then I realised I&#39;d have to think up another eight and I&#39;d have to find some way of describing or illustrating them.  So yeah I just got foetal basically. <p /><div>I woke, of course, to more snow, more big blank snow and then some - today was Minnesota and Wisconsin.  If I kept my mind relatively blank the day before, today was more of the same.  But today I had mobile coverage again, so I could check in on Foursquare (earning myself both the super user&#39;s badge and the over sharer&#39;s badge) and I could connect a little with others on twitter and by e-mail.  It&#39;s amazing how clear it is that you receive only small amounts of useful stuff in e-mail when you see a whole day&#39;s worth piled up in your inbox.</div> <p /><div>So, I did enough writing to assuage my work-guilt, plenty more slow video as the train halted or just got going.  I&#39;m thinking of finding a way to sew these clips together to make a movie that&#39;s just views from the train moving slowly.  It needs to not be too repetitive but it will have to wait till I&#39;m back and I&#39;ve got everything and I&#39;ve a machine in front of me that can handle editing video comfortably.</div> <p /><div>The train was filling up.  At Wisconsin Dells, I gave the other half of my double seat to Lindsay, a young singer (an actress really) with a blues band in Chicago.  I gave her a quick beginner&#39;s ukulele lesson and sang her a little song.</div> <p /><div>I had lunch on the train for the first time because my provisions from Seattle had run out.  Not the greatest cuisine on the planet, but it kept me going.</div><p /><div>It really didn&#39;t feel like 43 hours on that train.  Milwaukee is the cleanest, brightest, most modern Amtrak station I&#39;ve been to.  Sadly, it didn&#39;t have what I was expecting, a spare seat on the train down to Austin on Wednesday/Thursday.  I was told to call after midnight when there may have been some cancellations.  So I started to compose a &quot;Solve it while I sleep&quot; post in my head.</div> <p /><div>Tracy checked into the station on Foursquare while she was waiting for the lights across the road, so I knew when she was there.  Always good to see her, but just so good to see a known and friendly face after all that time.  After a little detour to her office to pick up choonz we headed for home.</div> <p /><div>Milwaukee has this weird contrast of being a heavy industrial city but also a lakeside town.  There&#39;s one stretch of highway up the coast and on one side I could easily have been going through anywhere in the Black Country and on the other there&#39;s this great stretch of water that I know is a lake but looks pretty much like the ocean to me.</div> <p /><div>@tappsestate is lovely and I got to meet @moethecat  - I struggled to get on the wifi because I didn&#39;t read the instructions properly but once I was on I managed to get my fix of getting through e-mail and catching up on twitter and stuff while Tracy fixed up jambalaya for the evening&#39;s festivities: a Mardi Gras party at her church (yes, you read that right - a *family friendly* Mardi Gras party that would be finished by 7.30) Part of me wanted to just crash out, but I&#39;m really glad I said yes to going out - we had a great time, lots of laughter, met lots of lovely people, lots of music, a masked parade - great food and I even got a temporary tattoo and some purple beads.</div> <p /><div><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lloyd-davis/5511326974/"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5257/5511326974_26351d82d6_b.jpg" border="0" width="500" /></a></div><p /><div>So we were home by 9pm but I had to work quite hard to stay up to talk to Amtrak after midnight.  I wrote my &quot;solve it&quot; post anyway in case I just fell asleep.  In the meantime the option of a lift from one of Tracy&#39;s friends dematerialised.  So I was very relieved when I spoke to Connie in California to confirm my reservation for the following day - so I put a little update line in the blogpost and went down to sleep in the TappsEstate Basement, resplendent, as you might expect, with cocktail bar, rainbow flag and kick-ass drum kit.</div></div>
