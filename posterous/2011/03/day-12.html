<div class='post_body'>Saturday was the first day I took my ukulele downtown.  I spent a lot of time with Phil - we had lunch with the Bambuser gang, streamed me playing outside the convention centre and went and played again over in the park where another guy was learning the lessons of trying to strum a steel-stringed guitar with your fingers (don&#39;t try it at home kids, especially, if like him you&#39;re playing someone else&#39;s guitar and you&#39;re going to have to explain to them why it&#39;s covered in your blood) <p /><div>Otherwise a blur of bumping into people.  Here&#39;s me and the lovely Jackie Danicki</div><p /><div><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jaxuk/5520810367/"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="" border="0" height="0" width="0" /></a></div> <p /><div>I also played uke while waiting in line for the Cheezburger party - haven&#39;t been so ignored since I last played at Chancery Lane on the Underground :)</div></div>
