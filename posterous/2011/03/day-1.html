<div class='post_body'>Day 1 was a very very very long day.  It started for me at 6am GMT, 5 hours later I was on a flight that lasted 11.5 hours and found myself on Pacific Time (ie feeling like it was midnight, but the clock saying it was 4pm). <p /><div>My body ached pretty much throughout the trip.  I think I&#39;ve been carrying a lot of tension in the run up to leaving.  I&#39;ve only partly let that go so far, but my shoulders, neck and head ache, though it&#39;s getting better.</div> <p /><div>I watched 3 movies: The Arbor, about Andrea Dunbar&#39;s family&#39;s experience after her death (message: life&#39;s a bitch and then you die), Middle Men, about the creation of online payments for the porn industry (message: family&#39;s more important than business), and Scott Pilgrim vs The World, comic-book/video game indie-style romantic comedy/kung-fu/coming of age with Michael Cer(message: love is really, really tricky)</div> <p /><div>I tried to drink lots and lots of water.</div><p /><div>I arrived in San Francisco - the line for immigration felt about 3 miles long, especially as it was full of screaming children - I would have loved to have been able to join in.  The only sticky bit was when I told the immigration guy I was an Artist and Musician (it just came out that way - thank god I didn&#39;t say &#39;social artist&#39;) .  &quot;How much money do you have on you?&quot; He was happy when I showed him my walletful of cash and cards and waved me on.</div> <p /><div>I managed to capture a few minutes of my state of mind on camera before I headed for the BART station.</div><p /><div><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/jE4jMCRteCc?wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen frameborder="0" height="417" width="500"></iframe></div> <p /><div>I didn&#39;t take in much of the ride on the BART but it certainly felt rapid - I hope to experience it again today.</div><p /><div>Then through the wonders of mobile technology, I was able to pick up the details of where I was staying from my hosts and how to walk there from the station.  I arrived and relaxed.  I will write a proper review, but I&#39;d found this place on <a href="http://airbnb.com">airbnb.com</a> and it looked a bit too good to be true.  It wasn&#39;t.  It was the perfect start to my journey - not as anonymous and lonely as checking into a hotel, not as socially demanding as being with friends - I felt fine just shutting myself in my room, tweeting a bit and then finding myself falling asleep... at 5.30pm.</div></div>
