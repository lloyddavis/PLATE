<div class='post_body'>Sunday didn&#39;t feel like a Sunday at all. <p /><div>Daytime was a lot of trying to get to meet people and being frustrated.</div><p /><div>I spent the afternoon at a #technomad meetup - lots of very interesting people using social technology to travel in different ways and generally be homeless without being *homeless*.</div> <p /><div>In the evening, I got more into the swing of it.  I had dinner at #globalgrill courtesy of UKTI and got to see @dominiccampbell, @rachelclarke and unexpectedly @rachelcaroe, </div><p /><div>then I met with @hotskillet, @ledgedancer &amp; @SidewaysMedia as the result of a tweet from @melindrift, </div> <p /><div>and I ended up at a #transmedia meetup thanks to @scott_walker and got to meet @skotleach, @jill380 and many others.</div><p /><div>Throughout I got the chance to repeat and refine and understand better the stories I have to tell as part of this trip.  </div></div>
