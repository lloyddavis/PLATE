<div class='post_body'><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lloyd-davis/5510747997/"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5140/5510747997_6604d89338_b.jpg" border="0" width="500" /></a></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> A long-distance train journey is a great opportunity for meditation. Especially when you find yourself without a phone signal most of the way and unable to connect to a carrier that will give you data at all. So after waking at Spokane (where a drunk guy was getting thrown off the train) and managing to check in to Foursquare, I was then cut off pretty much all the way across Montana and North Dakota. I managed to make a couple of voice calls and send some texts but that was all.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">So I could focus on what was going on inside my head with breaks occasionally to see what was outside the window.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Outside the window, I saw lots of ducks, geese, pheasants, some big black bird with a white head, lots of cattle, horses, several deer and a pack of coyotes wandering across the whiteness of the plain.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">It&#39;s great to get the chance to just sit and breathe and let the world go by. This is the thing with rail travel on this scale, there&#39;s so very little to do and so much time to do it in. Get up and walk about, use the rest rooms, get a coffee, sit in the Lounge car and get a better view and listen to some increasingly slurred conversation, read, write, take photographs and shoot video out of the window, not think too much about what&#39;s coming up.Â </p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">So that was my day.</p></div>
