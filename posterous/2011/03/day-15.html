<div class='post_body'>I didn&#39;t get any immediate and obvious answer to what to do about the next stage of the trip.  I made some efforts to continue trying to get a lift.  NOLA friends made some suggestions and I followed them all up, but no-one was keen on taking an unknown English guy on a 10-hour road trip.  There&#39;s an interesting point in there about how the value of social capital can degrade very quickly a couple of steps away in the network - I saw the same thing with the <a href="http://journal-racing.posterous.com" target="_blank">Journal Racing</a> prototype.  I became more resigned to not travelling to Lafayette until Thursday night.<div> <p /><div>So I sat and blogged some more and did the behind-the-scenes kind of Social Art, putting people together, saying hi to people I&#39;d met, cementing relationships, re-fueling social capital.</div><p /><div>Then i was ready to meet some new people again so after some frantic tweeting and false dawns I finally got together with @kevindwhite @rmiriam and @kittygutz there was ukulele</div><p /><div><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/znXMMeLVfKw?wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen frameborder="0" height="417" width="500"></iframe></div> <p /><div>Soon after this, Julia arrived and we sat and chatted until Nat was out of his panel then we headed up to Buffalo Billiards to meet up with various other brummies celebrating Helga&#39;s birthday but before we met them we had time to have a go at Shuffleboard.  Scoring is a bit like curling or bowls but you send a small lump of metal hurtling down a wooden runway covered in fine sand</div> <p /><div>This would have been my best shot if it hadn&#39;t been knocked off the end by the unexpectedly wildly competitive Julia Higginbottom...  </div><p /><div><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lloyd-davis/5534931301/"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5171/5534931301_123dd105b0_b.jpg" border="0" width="500" /></a></div> <p /><div>Before heading home, I slipped over 6th Street to  The Driskill as  I&#39;d seen Phil check in  a few minutes earllier.  He was there holding court with three women - Margaret Rosas (who was raving about Dave Gray&#39;s session earlier in the day),  Chelsea Rustrum whom we&#39;d met a the #technomads meetup and her Austin friend Kelsey Bryant.  There was much great conversation, occasional hilarity and of course I whipped my ukulele out again to much admiration from the ladies.</div> </div></div>

<div class='response_body'>Hey Lloyd! What a pleasure to meet you and hear your stories. I love the art of allowing. It's something I learned on my solo adventure last summer. When you flow with life and trust a little, remarkable things happen and the right people just show up. Enjoy the rest of your journey.</div>

<div class='response_body'>Thanks Chelsea, great to meet you too, thanks for the reminder - I may espouse this philosophy long and loud most of the time, but every now and then I lose sight of it.  One last push now - this time next week, I'll be back in London!</div>
