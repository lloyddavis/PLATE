<div class='post_body'>Maybe not so much to write on Southby days - it&#39;s a blur and difficult to differentiate the days once you&#39;re here. <p /><div>Wore my Learning Pool t-shirt, I know that much.  I need to write more about <a href="http://learningpool.com">Learning Pool</a> because they are good people doing good things.  I&#39;ll be wearing my tee again tomorrow and I&#39;ve a few of their postcards left to hand out about mylearningpool, their online training resource for community/voluntary groups and social enterprises.</div> <p /><div>Met <a href="http://twitter.com/rohan_21awake">Rohan G</a> for a delicious and mellow (but spicy!) thai/vietnamese lunch and got bonus <a href="http://twitter.com/kateho">Kate Ho</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/jessinscotland">Jessica Williamson</a> </div> <p /><div>Sat and wrote at the Convention Center for some time - the Trade Show doesn&#39;t start till Monday so there&#39;s an ongoing sweet power/wifi/perch spot outside there.</div><p /><div>Bumped into <a href="http://twitter.com/gabysslave">Julia</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/exsanguinator">Nat</a> and went for a coffee with Nat at The Hideout by way of the Apple pop-up shop to take a sharp intake of breath looking at the line around the block waiting for an iPad 2.  Headed back for a drink with the Higginbottoms and Jagir Patel who suggested I might like to talk at the Liberal Arts college in Huntingdon, PA where he went?/teaches?</div> <p /><div>Then caught up with Sarah, we went up the Frost Tower and met (among others) a delightful young lady in &quot;digital marketing for a real estate company&quot; so naturally fled and went to find Phil at The Ginger Man where we also found the whole <a href="http://chinwag.com">Chinwag</a> and <a href="http://wearesocial.net">WeAreSocial</a> gangs.  Escaped from there to Franks to fill Phil with hotdogs and found the <a href="http://madebymany.com">MadeByMany</a> posse in the line.</div> <p /><div>Um... and that was it.  I know Sarah &amp; Phil weren&#39;t impressed by being home by 10pm but it was a perfect night out for me...</div></div>
