<div class='post_body'><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>Patience &amp; Impatience</strong></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Half of my worrying time I'm thinking about the trip going too quickly and me not doing enough of the &ldquo;right stuff&rdquo;.  The other half I'm wishing I was further along.  Practicing patience is about accepting the present moment exactly as it is and trusting that the future will turn up exactly when and how it's needed</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>Vacation vs Work</strong></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">I really don't think anything I can say will convince someone who's made up their mind that this is a holiday scam that I'm actually doing some work except by producing some work.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>People not Places</strong></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">This thing about traversing a network of people rather than places &ndash; you know, I ended up in Milwaukee not just because it got me a little closer to Austin &ndash; it certainly wasn't a logical choice if you only look at the map.  But for this kind of journey, you have to have a look at the map <strong>and</strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"> your social graph and where those people find themselves.  Not only that, but where might there be people on the edges of your social graph (ie the friends of a friends you either don't know at all or know just a little bit). &nbsp;We don't map these things, online social networking has helped us make our graphs explicit and we've focused a lot on real-time location which tends to be at a finer level of detail than is needed for this trip.  I need to know which town people live in and whether there's a simple way of me getting there.</span></p>
