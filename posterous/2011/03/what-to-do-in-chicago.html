<div class='post_body'><p>I have a little layover on this leg of the trip and I'm looking for company. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">I arrive in Chicago at about 9am (Thursday, March 24<sup>th</sup>) if the train is running to schedule. My next train, to DC, is after 5pm.  So I have at least 7 hours to hang out and do stuff.  So what to do?  I'd love to meet anyone, talk about what they're doing talk about what I'm doing, hold a conversation circle, drink coffee, have lunch, work on something together, play ukulele, I don't know what, just anything really that will pass the time and create some social art in the process.  Is there a drop-in-friendly coworking space that's easy to find?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">I can always just sit in Union Station on my own all day but it would be nice to share the day with someone interesting.</p>
