<div class='post_body'>There&#39;s nothing like it getting dark over a cold, grey wet Illinois and waking up in glorious Arkansas sunshine.  I&#39;m back in the South - hurrah!<p /><div>Into Texas and we hit Dallas at around 11am.  I would have a double seat to myself from now on as Marisa was getting off.  We had a whole hour layover so I walked with Arie and Marisa away from the station for a while looking for coffee.  Thank heavens for Foursquare, we found a Museum Cafe and started walking towards it.  </div> <p /><div>I looked left to cross the road and there was something weirdly familiar about the scene.  I ignored it and kept walking but it was bugging me.  The I looked up and saw the memorial to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Dealey" target="_blank">George Bannerman Dealey</a>.  I was in Dealey Plaza.  Yes.  That&#39;s the former Texas School Book Depository Building and hmmmm... that grassy knoll over there... really weird, completely unexpectedly I was walking through a historical site, a place where a man had his brains blown out by an assassin or assassins about a year before I was born.  The museum we were heading to had loops of video of that day in November.  I didn&#39;t know how to feel, I can understand the power of the memory of that President, but commemorating violent death a few yards away from where that violent death  took place? I don&#39;t know, I still don&#39;t.</div> <p /><div><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lloyd-davis/5518489814/"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5174/5518489814_fd9d06928c_b.jpg" border="0" width="500" /></a></div><p /><div>Anyway we got some much better coffee that was available on the train and chatted with Kheira the barista who, on hearing we&#39;d found her via Foursquare said incredulously &quot;Really? How old are you?&quot; We explained that this is what we do and what SXSW is all about.  We encouraged her to spend her spring break in Austin and get a clue about this stuff :)<br /> </div><p /><div>Back on the train and able to stretch out.  I was impatient now to get to Austin - we had another 45 minute layover in Fort Worth, just half an hour or so away. I remembered how big Texas is West to East but hadn&#39;t quite clicked the North-South dimension too.  McGregor, Temple, Taylor no idea where I was just counting down to &quot;Next Stop: Aaaaaaaaaaustin Texasssss&quot;</div> <p /><div><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lloyd-davis/5517907569"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5255/5517907569_f873f2b6e0_b.jpg" border="0" width="500" /></a></div> <p /><div>Finally we were off the train.  The bizarre thing was that of course this was the same train that I&#39;d caught out of Austin last time I was here.  So the light was exactly the same as then (which is where my twitter/FB profile pic was shot) I made a little piece to camera about being back and headed off to stock up at Whole Foods and find beautiful people.</div> <p /><div>Which of course I did in the form of seesmic veterans aplenty.  @philcampbell, @orchid8, @danpatterson, @iKrissi - we headed from there to The Ginger Man I think where we met up with half the population of Birmingham and watched @hermioneway have video of herself shot from a handheld projector onto her bottom - enlightening stuff :)</div> <p /><div>And so to bed, chez <a href="http://helpattack.com/">@orchid8</a>, in my favourite bottom bunk bed in Austin, with rocket ship sheets - total luxury.</div><p /><div><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lloyd-davis/5518505732/"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5052/5518505732_7cf7e5b943_b.jpg" border="0" width="500" /></a></div></div>
