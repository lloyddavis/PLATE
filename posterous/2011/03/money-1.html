<div class='post_body'><div>One of the big lessons I learned this year from fundraising is not to rely on *anything* at all until it&#39;s in my account.  I had a few potential corporate sponsorship deals in the pipeline and I guessed that at least one of them would come through either before or during the trip.  None of them did.</div> <p /><div>I&#39;m hugely grateful of course to all those who&#39;ve given money, bought me meals and made me so welcome in their homes.  However, I need some more help.</div><p /><div>For those who don&#39;t know me, I have no income from employment in the UK this month  or next and I&#39;m about £2,000 ($3,200) short on being able to pay the rest of my bills back at home (my rent falls due in a week&#39;s time) and maintain my minimal levels of day-to-day expenses here.</div> <p /><div>So I&#39;m open to ideas in addition to the following:</div><p /><div>There&#39;s a donate button on the <a href="http://t2t2.posterous.com">sidebar of the blog</a>.  If you didn&#39;t put anything in the pot before the trip and you&#39;re getting some value out of what I&#39;m doing, please do consider contributing that way.</div> <p /><div>I&#39;m still open to <a href="http://t2t2.posterous.com/pages/sponsorship-opportunities">support from businesses and organisations</a> who either just would like an association with the trip or, preferably, for whom I can do something useful while I&#39;m here (though SXSWi is over from today).  <a href="http://perfectpath.co.uk/what-i-do/">This should give you an idea</a> of all the sorts of things I can do, if you don&#39;t already know.</div> <p /><div>Perhaps you&#39;ve heard me play ukulele and singing at some point on this trip - how about buying<a href="http://lloyddavis.bandcamp.com/"> my album on bandcamp</a>?  You can pay whatever you think it&#39;s worth.</div> <p /><div>And anything else you can thing of etc.</div></div>
