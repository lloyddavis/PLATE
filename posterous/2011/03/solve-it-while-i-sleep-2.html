<div class='post_body'>OK I&#39;m still in Half Moon Bay but tonight I&#39;m writing at 11.30pm when I&#39;m going to bed, in an attempt to put away stuff that otherwise would wake me at 3 :)  It seems to me this might be a good regular practice - to write any issues  down before I go to bed and see what you all come up with (if anything) overnight. <br /><div>I have 3 options for travelling on.  I&#39;m learning from a few hits and misses that I need both a feasible route *and* somewhere to stay where I&#39;m going.  I don&#39;t have that for any of the options yet.  Let&#39;s see if you can fill any of the holes.</div> <p /><div>Option 1: Go down to Long Beach, CA - I neither have a ride nor a sensible route for this by other transport - I have one offer of somewhere to stay one night.</div><p /><div>Option 2: Take the Amtrak from Emeryville to Denver - I have had promises of contacts there, but no-one I already know to stay with</div> <p /><div>Option 3: Take the Amtrak from Emeryville to Seattle - I have somewhere to stay provisionally, just waiting for confirmation that the timing&#39;s OK</div><p /><div>Now that I write it out like that, if I&#39;m intent on moving on out of the Bay Area tomorrow, then Seattle looks like the best idea.  However, that train leaves at about 11.30pm (not my first time joining a train just in time to get to sleep!)  The Denver train leaves at 9.10am - that might actually be too early for me to get there.</div> <p /><div>So I guess you can help most with places to stay in any one of those cities but also some way of getting from San Francisco to LB</div><p /><div>Do with this what you will... Melatonin is dragging me to bed...</div> <p /><div>I just need to say, I&#39;m not worried about this.  I trust that the perfect answer will emerge in time - and I&#39;ll be much more comfortable if I don&#39;t try to work it out alone.</div> </div>
