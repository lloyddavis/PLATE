<p>For the first time in a few days there was no need to get downtown before noon. &nbsp;Sarah was leaving for a conference in DC so we stayed at home, I did some much-needed laundry and took it fairly easy for once.</p>
<p>Phil needed to go in and do a last few interviews so Sarah drove me downtown <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">after</span> during lunch (drive-thru burgers - yum) and I got out and said goodbye while Phil got in and they both went off to the airport.</p>
<p>I'd become very accustomed to living with Sarah in just 5 days and hanging out with Phil a lot. I had that slightly-on-my-own feeling again.</p>
<p>Soon though I met up with Nat and Julia and we wandered along 6th Street, hung out in The Hideout for a cup of tea, wandered back along 6th Street and up Red River to find a cab. &nbsp;At last I got a real feel for what the music festival is like (at least in the afternoon, I can imagine what it gets like after dark...)</p>
<p>That night I got as far north out of Austin as I've been. &nbsp;Julia and Nat had kindly offered me the sofa-bed in their suite for the night, as there was no train until the following day. &nbsp;They also took me to dinner at the nearby Sam's Boat seafood place which Nat described as "a hand grenade of America going off in your face": TV screens with every sport you'd want; neon advertising for beer, beer and more beer; nautical paraphenalia in the middle of Texas; waitresses in white vests and denim shorts who write cute messages to y'all about coming back soon on your check.</p></div>
