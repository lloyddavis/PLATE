<div class='post_body'><p>I waited until this morning to see whether anything else popped up, but the decision had really become clear last night.</p>
<p>I have just got the last tickets on my pass with a lot of help from the excellent ticketing staff at Union Station, Washington.</p>
<p>This is how it's going to go: &nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm going to spend one last night on a train tonight - I leave DC at 10pm and get into Boston Back Bay about 8am then I dash across town to get from Boston North to Portland, ME leaving at 9.05 and then a bus from Portland to Belfast where I hope to get bear-hugged by Mr Neal Foley.</p>
<p>I've been promised a bed, lobstah (!) and good clean living - yay!</p>
<p>I'll be there all through Tuesday and leave at 8am Wednesday morning, back through Boston to New York, arriving at Penn Station at 9.50pm (subject to the usual disclaimers)</p>
<p><strong>So what needs sorting now is what to do in NYC from 9.50pm Wednesday until whatever time I need to leave to get a flight from JFK at 7.30pm Thursday. &nbsp;Fill me up folks! &nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Who to stay with?</span> <em><a href="http://sanforddickert.com">Sanford Dickert</a> FB'd me to say he has a bed (although he seems to be on his way back from London right now) </em>&nbsp;Who to meet on Thursday? Whether to do anything Wednesday after I arrive - city that never sleeps right?</strong></p></div>
