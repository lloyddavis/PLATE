<div class='post_body'><p>Well not quite, but this time next week I'll have been back in London for 24 hours.</p>
<p>So it's probably time to start counting backwards from then and getting some ideas of things to do between now and Thursday in place.</p>
<p>My flight from New York leaves at 7.30pm so I'll need to be at the airport by 5.30 I guess. &nbsp;That means if I want to do an evening thing in NYC with people I know, that will need to be Wednesday night. &nbsp;So the latest I want to arrive in the city is Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>I am currently scheduled up to Sunday afternoon, when Anne has offered to take me up to Philadelphia as she's going there for a basketball match. &nbsp;So I have Sunday afternoon/evening thru Wednesday afternoon to fill.</p>
<p>I had hoped (and still do) to meet up with Neal Foley (@podchef) one of my longest-standing social media buddies (he commented on my very first podcast at the end of 2004). &nbsp;He now lives near Belfast, ME but it really is looking like it's going to be too difficult to get up there. &nbsp;I still have 4 segments left on my rail pass. &nbsp;</p>
<p>So, simplest (at least in terms of travel) first. &nbsp;I could get a train from Philly to NYC on Sunday if I could find people to put up with me Sunday thru Thursday.</p>
<p>I could also get up to Boston on Sunday evening, see if there are folk to see on Monday and then come back down to NY for a couple of days.</p>
<p>The Maine option looks like Boston Sunday night staying with persons as yet unknown, early start on Monday to get up to Portland on the train then bus to Belfast. &nbsp;Two nights down on the farm and then Wednesday travelling back down to New York (7.55am start from Belfast - hey I'm staying with a farmer!) getting into Penn Station at 10pm (if it's on time) just in time to party!</p>
<p>Hmmm.... it's pretty tight ain't it? &nbsp;(Also depending on how they count segments, it might blow out my allocation of journeys on the rail pass and mean some journeys have to be paid extra for)</p>
<p>No matter what, I'm going to need at least one night on a couch in NYC (Wednesday) and possibly somewhere in Boston tomorrow night. &nbsp;I also need help working out what to do, where and with whom on Wednesday evening (possibly early but also possibly 10pm-ish - I know, that's early...!)</p>
<p>Show me the way, people! &nbsp;I'm going to go out and help Anne with some yard work while y'all work this one out for me. &nbsp;Call it... Solve it while I secateur :)</p>
