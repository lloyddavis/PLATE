<div class='post_body'><div><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lloyd-davis/5492408323/"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5259/5492408323_f94586b318_b.jpg" border="0" width="500" /></a></div><p />I knew that I didn&#39;t want my first night to be with friends.  I wanted to be able to do what I did, which was to sit in my room for a bit and then drop off to sleep.  I dropped off to sleep a little earlier than I&#39;d intended, but it&#39;s not the end of the world.  But I didn&#39;t need to be sociable with anyone.  I was asleep by the time my hosts got back from work.  I did get to spend some time with them this morning, but by then I was more human.<p /><div>At first I&#39;d planned to stay in a hotel the first night to cover this anti-social time.  But when it came to booking somewhere, I found myself really resistant to everywhere I looked.  That&#39;s when I thought I&#39;d have a look at AirBnB.  I&#39;d first heard about it late last year when I was looking for somewhere cheap to stay in Paris (which in the end didn&#39;t come off).  But I hadn&#39;t really looked at it properly, it seemed a bit odd, I don&#39;t know why really.  But when I looked this time, I quickly found something that looked perfect.</div> <p /><div>And it was. For $89 +$11 fee for AirBnB, I had a beautifully comfy bed in a spacious, light room, in a gorgeously decorated Victorian house a short walk from the BART at 24th St &amp; Mission.<p /> </div><div>My hosts Tania and Philip made me extremely welcome - I couldn&#39;t have asked for a better start to my trip.  I wanted to stay up later to help with jetlag, but by 5pm I was really flagging.  I was able to just shut myself away and slumber and although I was awake for chunks of the night.  </div> <p /><div>In the morning I emerged and said hello to Philip.  Who knew that the first person I would speak to properly when I hit the USA would be an expat Englishman originally from Dorchester? Tania was a little busier but Philip and I had a lovely chat uncovering mutual interests and resolving to meet up when they come over to London in the summer.</div> <p /><div>After they left for work, I hung around for a little and caught up with people online.  Then I set out to get some lunch and go up into the city.  I found a T-mobile store and got myself a US sim card for the month.  I now have unlimited calls and texts and 2GB of data for the month you can get me on +1-415-395-6224.</div> <p /><div>Then I walked along to CitizenSpace the ur coworking space and sat there for the afternoon, sometimes writing, sometimes just being. It was chilly.  I haven&#39;t quite got used to the climate and the need for corresponding clothing.</div> <p /><div>Then I took my first real train - I mean I&#39;d been on the BART but the CalTrain feels like a train - down to Palo Alto where Robert came to pick me up and take me to his home in Half Moon Bay.  It was great to see someone I already knew! After a 45 minute drive we pulled into his garage and then I was into the chaos of a home with two over-excited toddlers.  I was pleased though to have some hot delicious Persian food (rice with dill - yum!)  But I couldn&#39;t manage very much longer without sleep.  Took a melatonin and slept through till 3 am when I woke up worried and needed to blog...</div></div>
