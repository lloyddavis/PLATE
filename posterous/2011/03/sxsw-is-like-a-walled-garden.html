<h3>SXSW is like a walled garden</h3>

<div class='post_body'><div><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lloyd-davis/5518504150/"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5100/5518504150_517b471de2_b.jpg" border="0" width="500" /></a></div><p />This year I&#39;ve chosen not to buy a badge for SXSW.  If someone else was paying for it, I probably would have taken one, but last year, almost immediately after I bought my badge, I was wondering why I&#39;d laid out cash for it. <p /><div>So this week I&#39;m on the outside.  Not completely because the ground floor of the convention centre is open with wifi and power outlets galore.  But I don&#39;t get to go up the magic escalators this year.  There has been much grumbling among my peers about the agency kids, the general overwhelm of people who don&#39;t seem to get the same thing we get and the accent on the <a href="http://documental.ly/the-revolution-wont-be-advertised-sxswi" target="_blank">social web as a commercial tool</a>.</div> <p /><div>It occurred to me today that SXSW is becoming like the bit of the web we don&#39;t like but still (sometimes) participate in, the walled gardens of Facebook and the AppStore.  Not having a badge has given me a different perspective on the whole thing.</div> <p /><div>Some half-baked draft thoughts:</div><p /><div> There&#39;s a price on entry and it&#39;s all about the sell - literally yes, but also because &quot;they&quot; might easily be doing creepy stuff to us and we&#39;d never know (and only half care until it&#39;s too late).  There&#39;s also the constant nagging feeling that whatever I&#39;m doing, someone else is making more of a profit out of it than I am.  </div> <p /><div>It&#39;s difficult to share-out - there are limits on how much video &amp; streaming you can shoot without a press pass in sessions.  Live blogging is an ultimately unsatisfying experience for blogger and reader, especially when most of the content is a thinly veiled pitch or at best self-promo.  </div> <p /><div>The inside experience adds little value - there is far more intelligence, innovation experience in the room than there is on any panel.  There is much more value in the conversations that go on *because* of SXSW than the conversations that happen inside. Also because of the hyper-schedule, no-one has the capacity to make really good decisions on what to go to</div> <p /><div>Most people are still just playing stupid games that annoy the rest of us while advertisers try to grab us all by the eyeballs.</div><p /><div>And yet, we still keep coming (yes and I keep using Facebook) - at anyrate I have, for the people, the Americans that I might not see for years otherwise, but also, bizarrely to have a touch point with other people from the UK who I don&#39;t have an excuse to hang out with normally.  I feel a bit left out, but I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve felt left out both of the other years I&#39;ve been here.  I think I feel less like I&#39;m missing out because the option of going to a panel and missing something cool for something dismal has been taken away from me.</div></div>

<div class='response_body'>Thing is you can&#39;t really tell because there&#39;s this liminal space that is the ground floor where anybody can hang out at all.  Perhaps I should put a call out for people to declare their non-badgedness.<div><br /></div> <div>The trip as a whole is going fantastically Rob and I&#39;m glad to know you&#39;re following along :)<br /><br /></div></div>

<div class='response_body'>Your comments are really interesting - as someone who knows nothing about SXSW apart from following you for a few weeks I had had  a look at their web site and thought (1) blimey, that looks commercial and (2) uber-blimey, streaming courtesy of Pepsico, that's a message of some sort.  So I think you're in the right place and hope you're at least getting plenty of free carbonated drinks</div>
