<div class='post_body'>I think, both for my own peace of mind and to avoid that pained look when people ask, today&#39;s the day to book my flights.<p /><div>Here&#39;s my thinking, based on looking at Virgin Atlantic&#39;s site which (unusually) is quite cool with the concept that people might not fly back from the city they fly to:</div> <p /><div>I fly to San Francisco - that&#39;s simply the place on the West Coast where I know most people and gives me most flexibility for where to go onto next.</div><p /><div>I fly back either from NYC (Newark) or Boston again on the basis of &quot;most people known&quot; but which?  There&#39;s a £14 diffference between the open-jaw fares back from these (Boston&#39;s the more expensive).  <a href="http://twitter.com/thecustomer">Will Rowan</a> has offered to buy me a burger in NYC on 30th.  Do I make that decision, on the basis of first-come-first-served?</div> <p /><div>Virgin Atlantic today offers LHR-&gt;SFO on 1st and  EWR-&gt;LHR on 31st for £460.27  I think I&#39;m going to go for that unless anyone comes up with a compelling argument otherwise.</div><p /> <div>Of course if you know (or are) anyone in Virgin Atlantic or any other airline who can make this cheaper or free (in return for any of the things I can do) TODAY or before prices go up then please get in touch.</div></div>
