<div class='post_body'>It&#39;s getting more and more exciting. <p /><div>Bits of corporate support and sponsorship are coming together, though no announcements yet.</div><p /><div>I&#39;ve set up an <a href="http://igg.me/p/17975?a=46941&amp;i=shlk">IndieGoGo page</a> for individuals to contribute and help spread the word. Â If you want to help, of course a donation&#39;s great, but really really what I would love is if you could push that page out to your networks with a recommendation to help me out.</div> <p /><div>My parents have said that they will underwrite a 30-day Amtrak rail pass for me in return for including a photography project in what I do while I&#39;m away (more details of that later) I&#39;m hoping it makes them feel more secure that I&#39;m not going to be completely stuck :)</div> <p /><div>I&#39;ve started talking to friends in California about the first days of the trip - sadly it looks like <a href="http://www.loiclemeur.com">Loic</a> is going to be in NYC at that point, but I&#39;m hoping to be able to visit the lovely <a href="http://scobleizer.com">Scobles</a> in Half Moon Bay - not sure, of course, how long I&#39;ll be in the SF area but get in touch if you&#39;re there and want to meet up or do something interesting.</div> <p /><div>I&#39;m sorely tempted to move on from there down to Long Beach for the BIL Conference - it doesn&#39;t get me terribly far east, but y&#39;know it&#39;s the people :)</div><p /><div>Deep breath...</div></div>
