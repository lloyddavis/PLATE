<div class='post_body'>Thanks again to <a href="http://t2t2.posterous.com/pages/theyve-looked-after-me">everyone who&#39;s contributed already</a>.  It&#39;s amazing and heartwarming to me that so many people gave without me having to beg.  There has to be an end date for the campaign and I chose today (actually midnight PST which is 8am GMT) so that I&#39;d have the bulk of funds before I went away.  Credit Card donations are held in escrow until the end of the campaign and I won&#39;t get them until Friday.  So if you want to give something *before* the trip has started, maybe you didn&#39;t realise it was going to close or perhaps you&#39;ve changed your mind <a href="http://t2t2.posterous.com/if-youre-wavering-like-robnonsense-how-does-t">reading this</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/platefund">please do so</a>. <p /><div>By supporting this project you will be:</div><div>* increasing understanding of the dynamics of social capital created through social media</div><div>* co-creating an inspiring online adventure story</div> <div>* helping create a repository for a large amount of detailed source materials, licenced for use by anyone with some rights reserved. </div><p /><div>However, while I&#39;ve paid for my flights and have enough for basic expenses for the time being, I need to find some other ways of raising money to fully cover my overhead while I&#39;m away.  This is not only my rent (which is due towards the end of the month) and utility bills but also the weekly contributions I make to my children.  I&#39;m open to suggestions on how to do this - I&#39;m not necessarily convinced that it needs to be another indiegogo campaign, it might simply be about encouraging one-off <a href="http://perfectpath.co.uk/micropatronage/">micropatronage</a> donations - I trust that you&#39;ll all have better ideas than I can come up with.  </div> <p /><div>And I&#39;m not up to sorting it out tonight, I have to finish packing and want to be in bed at a reasonable time to get to the airport for 9am...</div></div>
