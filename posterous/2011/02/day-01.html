<div class='post_body'>So today is the first day of the week before I leave for the US. <p /><div>This time next week, I&#39;ll be on Pacific Time and though it&#39;ll feel like 11 it&#39;ll actually still only be 2pm </div><p /><div>Blimey!</div><p /><div>I&#39;m worn out tonight and going to bed very soon, but I&#39;ve decided I need to be keeping at least some notes from now on, to keep you, my supporters and detractors aware of what&#39;s going on and also to be able to remind myself later when I come to re-tell the story.</div> <p /><div>I&#39;m going to make a little video diary in a minute too, but not for publication yet - it&#39;s the beginnings of the movie.</div><p /><div>So today brought another $185 of contributions to the indiegogo pot.  </div> <p /><div>There was an awful lot of tweeting and retweeting - In general, the people who get it are very supportive.  Some of those who don&#39;t get it yet are asking questions which is really useful because it&#39;s making me think, but I had a couple of prior engagements today that meant I wasn&#39;t able to respond as quickly as I&#39;d like, I hate writing posts saying I&#39;m going to blog about this tomorrow, but that&#39;s what I&#39;m going to do.</div> <p /><div>I drew the attention today of @paul_a_smith aka @twitchhiker who did something similar but waaaaay more ambitious a couple of years ago - Somebody else had asked  about this privately too , so I&#39;m writing a post about the question of whether and how you should do something if it&#39;s &quot;already been done&quot;.</div> <p /><div>@hubmum asked whether it was &quot;a charity thing or fund my holiday&quot; I replied that it&#39;s neither, it&#39;s a performance piece, a writing and film-making project.  This needs some more explanation too.</div> <p /><div>@techfluffTV want to do an interview with me before I go, so I&#39;m going to do that tomorrow</div><p /><div>I had an approach from someone working with a car-rental firm in the states about potential support.  Thank you! Sadly I don&#39;t have a driving licence as I&#39;ve never taken a test so that&#39;s not going to work unless I take my own driver with me :)  Still looking for interesting ways to interact with brands large and small on this.</div> <p /><div>Right, enough.  I&#39;m making a rule that I&#39;m in bed before midnight this week and tonight well before...</div><div> </div><div>Tell me if something else happened  today that you think I should have mentioned!  </div></div>
