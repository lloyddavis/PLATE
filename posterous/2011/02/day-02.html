<div class='post_body'>I *was* very tired last night after I wrote. I was in bed by midnight and I slept until 10am this morning although I had a little wake-up-with-busy-head session for an hour or so around 6am.<p /> <div>I was reminded that I need to remember to take the big but difficult actions that I know will make progress rather than focusing on lots of peripheral stuff that&#39;s easy but doesn&#39;t get much done. </div><p /><div>Another $260 came in via indiegogo.</div><p /><div>I was also reminded that when I put stuff out there, there are people who don&#39;t get it immediately and they ask questions and offer criticisms.  I have to have a way of dealing with that, that isn&#39;t just about sweeping it away and saying it doesn&#39;t matter.  Yes &quot;h8ters gonna h8&quot; but I gain a lot more from engaging with questions and ultimately understanding the ideas better myself.</div> <p /><div>Having criticism voiced also drew out some thoughtful writing from supporters. Thank you.</div><p /><div>I&#39;m keeping a video diary that I&#39;m not publishing yet.  I expect to weave it into the movie.  I don&#39;t think I said anything in tonight&#39;s entry that I didn&#39;t put in posts today so it&#39;s not keeping stuff secret, just that I want to be able to thread the story together including some stuff that isn&#39;t released immediately.</div></div>
