<p>I learned, experientially, two important lessons during last year's trip that I thought I already knew. &nbsp;It turned out I knew the theory, but I needed some schooling in the practice.</p>
<p>Firstly, I learned that more interesting things happen when I give up (the illusion of) control over what happens next. &nbsp;The classic example of this was the day that I ended up jamming with twenty beaming ukulele-playing senior citizens instead of snoozing in a DC hotel room.</p>
<p>The second is the reason that I have this picture of a small street of shotgun houses in NOLA in my flickr stream. &nbsp;It's because when I was in New York, 5 days earlier, I blogged that we couldn't afford to pay for anywhere to stay and we needed help. &nbsp;And in no time Taylor had introduced us to his friend Laura who generously gave us the use of her house for four days, the front step of which I stood on to take that picture.</p>
<p>
<p>In a couple of weeks I'm going to have the chance to practice them again, except this time I've purposefully built them into the structure of the trip. &nbsp;What I've also learned is that I don't necessarily get to be immediately more comfortable with either of them, I just have to keep practicing.</p>
