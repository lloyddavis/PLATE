<div class='post_body'>One of the great things about putting this work in front of a wider audience is that people are engaging with it who don&#39;t already know me, like me,  understand what I&#39;m doing, get the way that I work.  That means I have to keep explaining it from different perspectives and not only does that hopefully help them understand what this project&#39;s about, it helps me understand better too.<p /><div>I think there are a couple of ways in which my approach is unusual.  </div><p /><div>Firstly this really is an experiment.  An experiment in which I truly don&#39;t know how things are going to turn out.  We generally don&#39;t do this.  In school when we do experiments, we&#39;re actually repeating a specific step-by-step process that someone else has gone through that has a known outcome and an intended educational point.  </div> <p /><div>I don&#39;t really do things step-by-step, I resist structure and rules like that.  If I&#39;m doing anything step-by-step exactly the way that someone else has done it, I&#39;m not aware of it.  </div> <p /><div>According to <a href="http://t.co/Wg1jX6w">his blurb</a>, Paul Smith set out to get as far as he could around the world for free with a target of New Zealand, while holding certain rules about the circumstances under which he would accept help, including that he could only take help from people on Twitter.  </div> <p /><div>That&#39;s not what I&#39;m doing.  I&#39;m improvising a journey through my online social network where some of the nodes are already known to me and some aren&#39;t.  Paul seems to have done it to show that it could be done and the extent to which you can find help on the road.  I&#39;m building on that to look at what all these relationships mean and what the value is.  </div> <p /><div>And while I know that my outcome is that I will return home at the end of the month, I don&#39;t know what the overall outcome of the project will be, I don&#39;t know how my relationships will be altered, augmented or diminished, I don&#39;t know what I&#39;ll learn about America, Americans and myself.  At the end, I&#39;m expecting to be able to say something interesting and useful around the nature of social capital, its dynamics and value, but I&#39;m entirely open-minded as to what I might say.</div> <p /><div>The aspect that makes all of this more novel is that I will also be writing about it as I go.  I&#39;ll be doing the equivalent of publishing my notebooks and source materials as I go.  So when I say I&#39;m going to write about my journey the question is how does that differ from any travel writer?  Well most travel writers (film-makers) don&#39;t write their book (make their film) in public, they squirrel away lots of notes and draft scraps and then pull them together for publication (screening).   And mostly they don&#39;t involve their &quot;audience&quot; in what they&#39;re doing until the travelling bit is done.  I&#39;ve been involving you in this from the start.</div> <p /><div>For most people out there, this way of working is unusual.  It&#39;s not new, but I think that it produces more interesting work than traditional approaches.  It&#39;s certainly the only way that I seem to be able to do anything.</div></div>
