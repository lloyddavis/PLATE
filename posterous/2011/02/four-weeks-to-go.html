<p>I just made this highly inspirational first video diary to mark 28 days until I'm going to be travelling to the US - I think it has the exciting motivational tone necessary to spur you all on to... um... do something.</p>
<p>Well actually no, it's not because I've got a cold and that's making me miserable and not think very straight, but I just wanted to say, y'know - I'm still here and I'm still plodding on.</p>
<p>I know from previous experience that this is a weird time - the project suddenly seems more real because it's happening next month, but despite all the talking I've done with lovely people and the tentative agreements that have been made, nothing is signed and sealed yet and so... and so... well so it maybe doesn't seem so real, it feels like there might just be a teeny tiny risk that it will all go pear-shaped and I'll have egg on my face.&nbsp; And pears and eggs just don't go, do they?</p>
<p>Nonetheless, you will have noticed that I've added two pages today for people interested in sponsoring the trip - <a href="http://t2t2.posterous.com/pages/about-the-trip" target="_blank">About the trip</a> describes what I'm doing in general terms.&nbsp; While <a href="http://t2t2.posterous.com/pages/sponsorship-opportunities" target="_blank">Sponsorship Opportunities</a> gives more details of the help I'm looking for.&nbsp; Please pass them on to anyone who might be interested or able to get involved.&nbsp; Each is available as a PDF download if you want to give them to people who are afraid URLs.</p>
<p>Those of you who know me will recognise this phase in Lloyd's process and will probably be rolling their eyes and shaking their heads.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Again.</p>
