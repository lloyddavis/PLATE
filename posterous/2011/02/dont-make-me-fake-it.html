<div class='post_body'><div>Tremendous bits of support coming in that I&#39;ll be able to talk about once they&#39;re confirmed.  However, while this is really really welcome, there&#39;s been much more response to help with kit than with direct cash support (to cover my overhead back here, some travel costs and contingency for daily subsistence).  </div> <p /><div>I&#39;m putting up an indie-gogo page shortly for small-scale donors but <a href="http://bit.ly/h6GEke">I&#39;m also offering things</a> like post-trip workshops with staff and product or brand evangelism.  I&#39;ve been joking today that I may have four laptops, six phones and a pocketful of dongles, but I may not be able to get over the pond in the first place!</div> <p /><div>Of course, it then occurred to me that I could do a Capricorn One-style fake journey.  Sit at home for a month, tweeting only during US daytime hours and working on putting together fake photos of me at a range of American landmarks - probably spending lots of time explaining to American friends how come I was in town but didn&#39;t manage to say hello!</div> <p /><div>I don&#39;t think that&#39;s going to be as interesting as actually doing the trip.  So if you know anyone who might be interested in supporting at the £250-£1,000 level do point them to me and share the <a href="http://bit.ly/h6GEke">sponsorship opportunities</a> page.</div></div>
