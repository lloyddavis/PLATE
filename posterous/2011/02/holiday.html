<div class='post_body'><p>Yesterday, Emma (<a href="http://twitter.com/hubmum" target="_blank">@hubmum</a>) asked "is this a charity thing or fund my holiday?". Today Milo (<a href="http://twitter.com/nero" target="_blank">@nero</a>)&nbsp;<a href="http://twitter.com/Nero/status/40438115160031232" target="_blank">said</a> "Social media moron redux&nbsp;<a href="http://t.co/tH7OOfT" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://t.co/tH7OOfT</a>&nbsp;Is this a spoof? The guy just wants you to pay for his holiday... What am I missing?"</p>
<div>I know that if someone's prepared to call me a moron, at least I'm doing something worth talking about. &nbsp;On the other hand, I think it's an interesting reaction and worth answering. &nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>Do I just want you to pay for my holiday? No, course not. The simple answer, I gave to Emma on twitter yesterday is that it isn't a holiday at all. &nbsp;"It's a performance, a writing and film-making project" and I'm using the tool of crowdfunding that is increasingly used as a way of people being able to make art projects happen by going straight to their audience beforehand without jumping through complicated funding hoops for big chunks of cash from big funding bodies or corporations.</div>
<p />
<div>I guess there are two bits that people have been interested in funding. &nbsp;The first is the performance. &nbsp;They'll enjoy watching me make my way coast-to-coast, seeing what happens, where I go, what I learn, being part of the adventure without having to go and do it themselves.</div>
<p />
<div>Then there's the writing and film-making - people want &nbsp;to hear the whole story with some reflection and analysis - some people are particularly interested in the social capital angle, understanding what the value is of working in this way - some people are just taken with hearing a hero's journey played out by someone they know.</div>
<p />
<div>That's why I think people are supporting my work, but I'd be fascinated to hear more from those who've already &nbsp;contributed and anyone who's wavering too.</div></div>

<div class='response_body'>I'm afraid I don't really understand either. I've been reading your posts about the trip, and keep thinking "what am I missing?", although I thought maybe it would be rude to ask...<br />What I'm wondering is what are you performing, writing and film-making *about*? If I'm funding an art project, I want it to be about something more meaningful to more people than the making of the art project itself. <br />I'm trying to think about it without seeing my brain getting tied in knots. "I'm making this trip to tell the story about making this trip to tell the story about making this trip to tell the story about..."</div>

<div class='response_body'>I admit to funding Lloyd for a couple of reasons, <br />firstly I admire him and the work he does.  I like the way he feeds back on things he does and by funding the trip (a little bit) I feel like I am giving him the ability to feedback on stuff I can learn from.<br />secondly, I know what it's like to feel like you don't have enough funding to give a project the full support it deserves and so I wanted to help because at this moment in time I can (I'm not able to be a regular micro-funder of Lloyd's antics)<br />thirdly, from a purely selfish point of view it means I will be able to pick Lloyd's brains when I need to without feeling too guilty about taking up his time but not being able to pay his going rate or officially “hire” him<p>Lloyd isn’t the only person to be using this sort of route to do things he wants to do while sharing the love with a bunch of others…check out @philcampbell and his fibrecamp (<a href="http://fibreca.mp/" rel="nofollow">http://fibreca.mp/</a> ) project and the <a href="http://helpbuildtheark.com/" rel="nofollow">http://helpbuildtheark.com/</a> project.</p><p>Don’t feel obliged to give, do it because you want to and you see some value in it, I certainly do</p></div>

<div class='response_body'>Thanks Emma, it's not rude to ask - if you think the emperor's got no clothes on, it's important to say so  :)<p>I'm sorry your brains getting tied in knots too.</p><p>So at a simple  level you could treat this as just another bit of travel-writing, in which writers often go on trip in order to write about a trip usually finding there's much more to the internal journey they go on than the external.</p><p>The twist for me is that I don't know where I'm going to be going in between the beginning and the end of the month.  I'm going to let other people make suggestions for how it turns out and I'm seeing what happens when I ask my friends for help.</p><p>It also seems to me that this gives us some insight into what the value of the social capital is that we build through using social media.  If I had no online social network at all, the trip would cost a lot more and be a very different experience.  So it's also a different angle on the often asked question: "What's the ROI on social media"  </p><p>I don't know if and how it's going to work and I don't mind who does or doesn't help fund it but my work is increasingly about just trying stuff and seeing what happens.</p></div>

<div class='response_body'>Hey Lloyd, I think you're opening up a really interesting debate here. <p>I can totally see why some people think it's just about paying for your holiday, after all most people work their arse off all year for a boring 2 week holiday. You're living the dream, heading off on a fairly open ended adventure across the US with SWSX thrown in too!</p><p>On the other hand I totally see your point of view in that you are creating and documenting a fascinating adventure and social experiment that will might be of value. Plus you've got the balls to actually do it even faced with huge uncertainty.</p><p>Maybe there is a wider debate to be had here around money/value/capital. For example if you were putting this forward as a documentary where people could invest and get a return on any profits that came from the film, then I'm sure nobody would have an issue. They would take a calculated gamble and importantly they would have the chance of directly benefiting from the trip, i.e. Capitalism.</p><p>Personally I find it fascinating, you're a social artist with a (positive) intangible output that's hard to see or quantify, living in a capitalist society that trades money for value. Maybe the tension here is because it's not very clear what the value exchange is for the patron or if there is any at all.</p><p>Some people need a return (so they won't get what you're up to or be negative), some people don't mind a deferred return (it might make them feel good, entertained, or create +ve karma or serendipity), some people really don't care and are purely generous (if you believe these people exist!).</p><p>Crowdfunding like Kickstarter.com usually states what's in it for the crowdfunder so I'm not surprised that you are getting grief from folks who can't see any return and would rather spend their money taking themselves off somewhere nice.</p><p>Tricky one and would be interested to hear what others think. </p><p>Keep pushing the boundaries though Lloyd and ignore the detractors, they are just jealous! :D</p></div>

<div class='response_body'>Hello everyone. I contributed and reading this has made me think a bit more about why I did. <p>Firstly, I think Lloyd is a truly lovely human being. I don't really know him that well either, which makes that statement seem quite strange. But there you go. Where I can help out anyone I can, I will (and do). </p><p>I'm also a big believer in karma. (I've turned down money and made some decisions that don't make sense commercially, purely on the basis of this) So, in a similar way to Kat, in some way I see my contribution as being a way of alleviating any guilt I might have in asking Lloyd for help in the future. I also see it as thanks for all the ways Lloyd has helped me in the past. </p><p>Lloyd - I wish you all the best, as ever, and look forward to seeing what happens on your trip  :-)</p></div>

<div class='response_body'>I meant to comment on this last week, but the joys of mobile internet intervened...<p>For me, the questions about Lloyd's work come down to intent. I don't necessarily understand social art - Lloyd and I have discussed this before - but that actually makes it more interesting.</p><p>Were I to imitate Lloyd and try this, it wouldn't be art: I wouldn't be creating anything per se (though I might create art along the way!).</p><p>I keep coming back to artists who work in the environment - Richard Long, Andy Goldsworthy and so on. They create temporary works which they document in a variety ways. They work in a variety of media. Long makes long walks, for instance.</p><p>I go on long walks; I am not an artist in the way Richard Long is, since making art isn't the reason for my going on a walk.</p><p>So I don't really understand Lloyd's work: but I really support it, perhaps because I don't understand it. It makes me think about things - the world, making art - in new and different ways.</p><p>And THAT is why I think Lloyd's work is art.</p></div>

<div class='response_body'>Hi Lloyd,<p>I'm still making my mind up whether to contribute. Partially that's because I'm not sure I'll enjoy the content that much... I mean, I know it will be interesting, and insightful and potentially funny in places; but my jealousy of your trip may ruin it for me!</p><p>I'm, serious here - if you were doing something I couldn't imagine I'd love doing, I'd be more up for paying. Does that make me a bad person?! Dunno.</p><p>Oddly, if this was an investment by me, I'd feel different. I think this might (maybe-just-maybe) make a good book or film one day - especially if something truly incredible happens along the way (like maybe you get abducted and have a harrowing experience yet survive unharmed).</p><p>So, my question to you is this. How would you feel about a contribution that effectively bought part of the rights to sell the story after? My percentage to be shared proportionally with all other contributors. Say with you owning, let's see... 51%</p><p>Would this kill the art? Would you want a bigger cut?! (I'm asking because I find this really interesting, and would love to hear your answer... and because part of me thinks if you want to co-fund something, you should profit share... although I'm sure profit is very far from your mind - I'd just like you to think about it.)</p><p>Cheers dude,</p><p>Rob</p></div>
