<div class='post_body'><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lloyd-davis/4459778413/"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4052/4459778413_d13b635732_b.jpg" border="0" width="500" /></a> <p /><div><a href="http://indiegogo.com">IndieGoGo</a> has the concept of Perks - incentives for people to contribute, these might be simply emotional: &quot;We&#39;ll love you forever and you&#39;ll feel warm and fuzzy&quot;; they might entitle donors to access to early product &quot;Get a DVD of the rough-cut  of our movie&quot;; or something else connected with the project, t-shirts, high-res images, etc.  It really can be anything you can give to people.  You then associate levels of perk with levels of donation, so the ones for $100 are cooler than those for $10.</div> <p /><div>I&#39;m having a bit of a creative/imagination failure about what <a href="http://bit.ly/platefund">I can offer here</a>.  Last year we sent postcards to everyone who made a donation (and gave us a postal address)  I&#39;d like to do that again, but it might be nice to have some way of expressing gratitude at the very low level as well as higher up.</div> <p /><div>So what would *you* want?  What can I give you, associated with this project that would encourage you, or people you know to make a donation?  No promises of course, and I can keep it without perks until I have some good ideas, but I&#39;d quite like to add something in.</div></div>
