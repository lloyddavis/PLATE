<div class='post_body'><div class="gmail_quote">We&#39;re into the final hours of <a href="http://bit.ly/platefund">the indiegogo campaign</a> and I&#39;m preparing to fly to San Francisco tomorrow morning. </div><p /> <div class="gmail_quote">In the <a href="http://t2t2.posterous.com/holiday" target="_blank">comments of a previous post</a>, Rob Mosley said:<p /><div>&quot;<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;"><i>I&#39;m still making my mind up whether to contribute. Partially that&#39;s because I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll enjoy the content that much... I mean, I know it will be interesting, and insightful and potentially funny in places; but my jealousy of your trip may ruin it for me!</i>&quot;</span></div> <p /><div><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;">and added:</span></div> <p /><div><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;">&quot;</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;"><i> How would you feel about a contribution that effectively bought part of the rights to sell the story after? My percentage to be shared proportionally with all other contributors. Say with you owning, let&#39;s see... 51%</i></span></div> <div style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px;"> <i> Would this kill the art? Would you want a bigger cut?! (I&#39;m asking because I find this really interesting, and would love to hear your answer... and because part of me thinks if you want to co-fund something, you should profit share...</i> &quot;</p> <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px;">So I wholeheartedly agree with the sentiment, but don&#39;t feel comfortable with the profit-share idea as a solution.  I do want you to benefit from the material I create, I want to share it, I want you to be able to find insights and meaning that I&#39;m not able to see, but I don&#39;t want to  feel saddled with the responsibility for making a financial profit - even if that&#39;s not what people are expecting, it&#39;s an expectation that I would put on myself.</p> <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px;">What it shows me is that I haven&#39;t made something explicit that I think I made explicit last year - doh! </p> <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px;">I&#39;ve left something assumed that is actually quite important.  I&#39;ve said that I will write a book and make a movie out of the material that I will gather on the trip.  What I haven&#39;t talked about is what you will be able to do with that material.  Would it change your mind if I were to say that all the material I collect will be made available online under a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BY-NC-SA">Creative Commons licence</a> (probably <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/uk/">by-nc-sa</a>) ?  So that I&#39;m creating a free to use repository of research material which you can delve into?  I would retain the copyright of it all, but you could use it without asking permission if. you attribute me as the original source, you don&#39;t charge for what you do with it and you share it under the same conditions?  </p> <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px;">So rather than investing in something that needs to be a business, you&#39;ll be investing in me creating a common good.  If you do want to create a commercial product based on the material (or use the material in any other way not covered by the license), then I am likely to agree, but I reserve the right to be asked first.  The other thing I&#39;ve left unsaid is that I&#39;ll do an event for those who contributed and can get to Central London to explain what I found, what happened and what material is available.</p> <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px;">This, incidentally, is almost the same as how Tuttle works - any member can make anything they like out of what goes on there but only I get to use the Tuttle name on commercial offers (and those have involved profit-share) - and I think that&#39;s why people who know me from that sphere have been more willing to just jump in.</p> </div></div></div>

<div class='response_body'>Creative Commons is always good. CC-by-SA works well, especially if it also covers any photography. Bonus points for checking Wikipedia as you go and filling in free-use images for subjects that are currently not illustrated, especially living people.<p>In fact, if you did that, I bet I could persuade Jimmy Wales to throw a dolar or two into the kitty :-)</p></div>

<div class='response_body'>Hi Lloyd,<p>Totally get where you're coming from here... the idea of making a profit would really change the feel of the project, for you more than anyone - not a good thing as you're fairly pivotal to it! And I wouldn't want to be responsible for making it all commercial either.</p><p>I like the content-sharing bit. I hadn't gathered that from what I'd read. And I like the idea of being able to do whatever I like with your content. Am sure bits and bobs would find their way into decks for client presentations. Kinda wish I had more than 9 hours left to think of something really cool I could do with it, because that would help convince me to cough up!</p><p>Obviously I can get all this without investing... but am guessing if everyone had that attitude there'd be less content / worse content. (Although you struggling against adversity might be just as interesting... this is tough!)</p><p>Gonna have to make my mind up in the morning.</p><p>Night, man.</p></div>
