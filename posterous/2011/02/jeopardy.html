<div class='post_body'><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lloyd-davis/5452683449"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5100/5452683449_cafdb21b27_b.jpg" border="0" width="500" /></a><p /><div>This is me at the end of the line last year - sitting in Union Station, Los Angeles having made it coast-to-coast despite my constant doubts that it would happen. I&#39;m starting to have those doubts again from time to time, but I look at myself there and see my shaggy unshaven self just off a 36-hour train journey and I remember the cool fresh spring air (yes, in downtown L.A.!) and the sunshine and knowing that there never had really been any doubt - uncertainty about the detail perhaps, but no real risk that it wasn&#39;t going to happen.</div> <p /><div>This is the nub of good story (and I think by extension, a good life), we want to know it&#39;s all going to turn out all right in the end, but we also crave doubt, uncertainty, jeopardy.  We need that uncertainty to throw the success into relief - if all we ever did just worked out exactly to plan we would never know the ecstacy of success, it would all be the same - win after win after win after win.</div> <p /><div>The trick as an artist, performer, writer, human being is to remember that we have created the possibility of downside *in order* that the upside can exist, and to make it all the more delicious.  The journey is much more comfortable though if I can remember that it&#39;s just an illusion that I&#39;m using to make the story interesting and to motivate myself to action.</div> <p /><div>So I know that at the end of March, I&#39;ll have some similar shot of me looking tired, wrinkled, dishevelled, but happy and satiisfied that I&#39;ve completed something.  And then I&#39;ll start all over again.</div></div>
