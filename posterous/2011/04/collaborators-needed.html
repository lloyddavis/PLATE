<p>The conception, development and execution of the journey were all carried out in the same way. &nbsp;I thought about things, i wrote about them, I wove the responses to my writing together with person-to-person conversations I had into decisions about which way to go next. &nbsp;That. Repeated over and over.</p>
<p>Before the trip, I spoke to people around me at the Centre, at Tuttle, friends, random acquaintances. On the trip, I spoke to the people I was staying with or with others I encountered as well as occasionally checking back in with my London friends.</p>
<p>Now I'm back, I feel like I'm not doing that so much. &nbsp;I think it's because I don't know how to shift gear and ask for a different kind of help. &nbsp;I am fine with getting help opening up options and making short-term decisions. &nbsp;Closing things down, getting them down on paper and turning them into something interesting, noteworthy, remarkable, valuable, not so much. &nbsp;Somehow I want to do that all by myself, I think I have to draw a line on collaboration, retreat to my cave and produce *my* thing, *my* product, *my* story.</p>
<p>I'm looking for people to work on this together. &nbsp;I feel like an actor who needs a director, a journalist who needs an editor, or something. &nbsp;I could be wrong about what or who I need, I just know I need help, challenge, support, something other than me to go any further.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having written that, i recognise that it's not as entirely open as that. &nbsp;I think I need people who already have some understanding of what I'm doing and some affinity with it. &nbsp;Help conditional on me being able to explain to you from first principles exaclty what we're doing and why is no help at all at the moment. &nbsp;If your response is "I'd love to help you, but I don't really understand what you're doing" then thank you for the offer, your time will come, but right now I need something else.</p></div>
