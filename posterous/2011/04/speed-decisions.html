<div class='post_body'><p>On the first day I was in San Francisco I was advised "You need to give people more time to help you".</p>
<p>One of the key bits of character building in this trip has been letting go of impatience, allowing things to happen in their own time. &nbsp; Allowing the route to unfold in its own time. &nbsp;Allowing people to get in touch, or not, when they were able to. &nbsp;Asking for help and receiving it when it came rather than hassling people for an answer so that I could feel better.</p>
<p>In the decision-making process I tried not to give unrealistic deadlines. &nbsp;I tried to say "These are the options I see, I'm going to wait a reasonable amount of time (at least 8 hours, though I never articulated it like this) and then I'm going to make a decision with the information I have"</p>
<p>That meant that on occasions I was making decisions with no new information. &nbsp;At this point I was left wondering "Have I given them enough time? &nbsp;Will I get anything from waiting any longer?" and then press on with the best information I had at the time.</p>
<p>Because of the way I'd chosen to travel, I couldn't always leave things to the last minute. &nbsp;There are a finite number of seats on a train and Amtrak don't oversell and let people stand - when faced with a full train in Milwaukee, I kept trying until I got a seat - when I was heading for Washington from Chicago I just took a slightly later, longer journey.</p>
<p>All in all, I became aware that my judgement of how long it should take to make a decision was not nearly as long as it needed to be. &nbsp;I often felt stressed and worried that if things weren't going to my schedule, they were going "wrong" but again and again, it all worked out beautifully.</p></div>
