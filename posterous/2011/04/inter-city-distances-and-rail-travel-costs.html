<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lloyd-davis/5517895583"></a>Disregarding all of the travelling I did while in each city, I made a total of 15 inter-city journeys. &nbsp;Legs 3 &amp; 4 and legs 5 &amp; 6 had only an hour stop in between so each felt like only one journey. &nbsp;Likewise 10, 11 &amp; 12 Washington to Belfast and 13, 14, &amp; 15 Belfast back to NYC. &nbsp;</p>
<p>You have to draw the line somewhere... &nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyhow, taking a mixture of Amtrak's timetable and estimates from Google Maps (since the North Eastern timetables don't publish distances) and adding in the road journey from Lafayette to New Orleans. I came up with the following distances (in miles)</p>
<ol style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;">
<li>San Jose to Seattle &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;954&nbsp;</li>
<li>Seattle to Milwaukee &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2120&nbsp;</li>
<li>Milwaukee to Chicago &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;86 &nbsp;</li>
<li>Chicago to Austin &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1223&nbsp;</li>
<li>Austin to San Antonio &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 82&nbsp;</li>
<li>San Antonio to Lafayette &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 428 &nbsp;</li>
<li>Lafayette to New Orleans (by road) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;135</li>
<li>New Orleans to Chicago &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 934&nbsp;</li>
<li>Chicago to Washington &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 922&nbsp;</li>
<li>Washington to Boston &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 460</li>
<li>Boston to Portland &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;125</li>
<li>Portland to Belfast &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;100&nbsp;</li>
<li>Belfast to Portland &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;100&nbsp;</li>
<li>Portland to Boston &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;125</li>
<li>Boston to NYC &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 240</li>
</ol>
<p style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;">I make that 8,034 miles</p>
<p style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;">I reserved them in eight chunks as each next leg became clear. &nbsp;The 30-day, 12 segment rail pass cost $579 and I had to pay an extra $50 for bus tickets from Portland to Belfast and back because that took me over 12 segments.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;">Had I paid for tickets individually at the point that I made each decision (discounts are available for advance booking but I didn't know any of this in advance), they would have cost as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;">San Jose to Seattle &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;$158</li>
<li style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;">Seattle to Milwaukee &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;$347</li>
<li style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;">Milwaukee to Austin &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $144</li>
<li style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;">Austin to Lafayette &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $67&nbsp;</li>
<li style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;">New Orleans to Chicago &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;$112</li>
<li style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;">Chicago to Washington &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;$133</li>
<li style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;">Washington to Belfast &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;$222</li>
<li style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;">Belfast to NYC &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;$137</li>
</ol>
<p>That gives a total of $1320 (&pound;858*)</p>
<p style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;">Total actual cost of inter-city travel = $579+$50 = $629 (&pound;408.85)</p>
<p style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;">So buying the rail pass more than halved the cost of travel, saving me $691 (&pound;449.15)</p>
<p style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;">And on average, I paid just under 8 cents (just over 5p) per mile for this travel.</p>
<p>*at the time of the trip the exchange rate was roughly $1=&pound;0.65</p></div>
