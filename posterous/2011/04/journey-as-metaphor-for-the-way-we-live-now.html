<p>Why is the idea of a journey important right now? &nbsp;How can we use the ideas about a journey to help us understand things that are changing or confusing or just too complicated in our everyday lives? &nbsp;</p>
<p>That's what I'm trying to do here. &nbsp;Although I enjoy travelling and telling stories about what happened, just because what happened was fun, unexpected or interesting, I'm much more interested in drawing out what they mean and what the whole thing means about how we live life.</p>
<p>I don't know why it's taken me so long to say that, I got too tangled up in just letting people know I was still here, still going, still OK.</p>
<p>Back to the question. &nbsp;Why is it important? &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Because deep down we know that the current form of organising society and our economy is no longer working, has not been working for some time, is highly unlikely to go back to working the way it used to.</strong> &nbsp;</p>
<p>We can feel the ache to bud and blossom in some new way. &nbsp;We just don't know what that new way will be. &nbsp;It is entrepreneurs and artists who will create it. &nbsp;The people who play with new ideas and try them out. &nbsp;They are on a journey, on the uncharted path to the future, they try things, they put things out there that are half-baked, that they don't really understand themselves yet, because that's the only way to understand them. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And all around them people are saying "No! Don't do that! &nbsp;Keep doing the old thing, stay at home, in the old place. You have to know what you're going to do before you set out so make a very detailed and accurate plan. If you really must go out there, only follow the paths that others have trodden before you"</p>
<p>But they're wrong, the important thing is to set out, to get on the road. &nbsp;And everyone who does that is in a little way making it easier for others to do so too and ultimately making it possible for us all to survive. &nbsp;And so those people need encouragement. &nbsp;They need to be affirmed and told that they are doing the right thing. &nbsp;And that is why they deserve to have art made about them and what they do, to help them and the people around them to understand what they are doing and how they are living. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And that's what this is all about.</p></div>
