<p>I sat for a while on the steps of the memorial to Thomas Jefferson on Sunday, following the line of sight of his statue across the tidal basin, the Washington Monument and the White House in the distance. &nbsp;Next to me a young girl was asking her father questions about freedom and what <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_Memorial#Description">the words written on the walls of the memorial</a> mean. &nbsp;All around us were the fresh blossoms of cherry trees, a <a href="http://www.nps.gov/cherry/cherry-blossom-history.htm">gift from the people of Japan in 1912</a>&nbsp;beautiful every year, but all the more poignant given the earthquake and tsunami of a few weeks before.</p></div>
