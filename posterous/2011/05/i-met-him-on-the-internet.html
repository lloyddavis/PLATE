<p>"I met him on the internet..." That was the innnuendo-laden way that I was introduced to many people in the US by my hosts - it usually got raised eyebrows and giggles...</p>
<p>It's the alternative title to my <a href="http://plateshow01.eventbrite.com">Please Look After This Englishman show</a> at C4CC on 24th and 25th May.</p>
<p>The evening will consist of a series of stories and songs (with ukulele!) retelling the journey and pulling out some general themes but also shining a light on what I learned about America, Americans and social capital.</p>
<p>Do come along, it'll be fun! I'll be selling tickets for cash (&pound;10) at #tuttle (or anytime you bump into me actually...) which saves you the whopping online booking charges :)</p></div>
