<p>Not me - other people, always other people...</p>
<p>It's been interesting talking to people here (mostly those who aren't active online social networkers) about the trip.</p>
<p>Firstly they perceive the risk of the trip as a whole to be much greater - it's clear that those of us who live a lot of our lives online get that everything's going to be alright.&nbsp; If you're not used to it, it does seem a bit risky and scary.</p>
<p>But what else comes out, I think, is just a British fear of America.&nbsp; I've been variously told that I will end up being shot, chopped up in pieces in someone's basement in Arkansas or wake up dressed in a gimp suit and ball gag and abused in unspeakable ways.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks Hollywood!</p></div>
